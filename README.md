# Emergence-of-Cooperation-Genetic-Algorithms
An exploration into how genetic algorithms can recreate the results of the famous Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma problem.
The following genetic algorithm is designed to model human intuition and perception in the Iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma. This project explores whether specific personality traits enhance performance against selfish agents in a tournament setting. Each agent is assigned an “Agreeableness”, “Forgiveness”, “Apologetic”, “Easy-Going”, and “Memory Emphasis” score. These traits, combined with a perception model that estimates an opponent’s likelihood of cooperating, guide the agents’ decision-making strategies. The projects findings provide insights into the evolution of cooperative behaviors in competitive environments.
